Difference Between PrivateKeyEntry and trustedCertEntry in a Keystore
---------------------------------------------------------------------
Entry type: PrivateKeyEntry
-----------
    What It Means

    This entry contains both a private key and its associated certificate chain (public certificate + CA chain).
    It is used for SSL/TLS servers (e.g., Tomcat, Nginx) that require a private key to establish HTTPS connections.

Entry type: trustedCertEntry:
----------------------
    What It Means

    This entry contains only a public certificate (without a private key).
    It is used for trusted CA certificates (like root or intermediate certificates).
    It cannot be used for SSL/TLS server authentication because it lacks a private key.

Conclusion

    If you want to use a certificate for SSL, you must have a PrivateKeyEntry.
    If you only need to verify other certificates, a trustedCertEntry is enough.
