Types of Certs:
=============
1)SSL/TLS Certificates (X.509)
    Used for HTTPS connections to encrypt data transmission.
    Can be self-signed or issued by a Certificate Authority (CA).
    Usually consists of:

        Server Certificate (.crt or .pem)
        Private Key (.key or .pem)
        Intermediate CA Certificates (.crt, .pem, or bundled as chain.pem)

2)Java Keystore (JKS) & PKCS12 Certificates (Tomcat-specific)
    Apache Tomcat typically uses Java Keystore (JKS) or PKCS12 (.pfx, .p12) format to store certificates.
Key types:

    Keystore file (.jks, .pfx, .p12) – contains private key and certificates.
    Truststore file (.jks, .p12) – contains trusted CA certificates.

3)Root and Intermediate CA Certificates

    Used for certificate chain validation.
    Stored in /etc/pki/tls/certs/ or /etc/ssl/certs/ in RHEL.

Apache (httpd)

    /etc/httpd/conf.d/ssl.conf (SSL configuration)
    /etc/pki/tls/certs/ (public certificates)
    /etc/pki/tls/private/ (private keys)

Tomcat

    /etc/tomcat/conf/keystore.jks (Java Keystore)
    /etc/tomcat/conf/server.xml (SSL/TLS settings)
